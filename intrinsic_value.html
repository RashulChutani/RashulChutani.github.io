        <hr class="my-2">
        <p>What is intrinsic value of a stock?<br>
            It is an estimate of ‘true value’ of stock. True value means what?<br>
            A right price, that a stock deserves to be paid for.<br>
            In stock investing, these two activities are most important:
            <ul>
                <li>Selection of right stock (strong fundamentals).</li>
                <li>Knowledge of right price (undervalued).</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Why these activities are important? </strong>
            <p>Because 
            Share market is full of more bad quality stocks than good ones. Hence screening-out bad ones is a big task. 
            Moreover, majority quality stocks generally trade at overvalued price levels. Hence screening-out overvalued ones is again a big task. 
            Buying only quality stocks which trade at undervalued price levels is the strategy that must be followed.
            </p>
            <strong>How to do it?</strong> <br>There are two ways:<br>
            Learn to estimate intrinsic value by self, or<br>
            Use a suitable intrinsic value calculator. 
            This way one can approximately establish if the stock in consideration is undervalued or overvalued. 
            <br><br>
            <p><strong>Why so much fuss about undervalued stocks? What are undervalued stocks?</strong>
            <br>
            The stocks which trade at a price below its right price can be called as undervalued.
            <br>
            If one wants to become a profitable long term investors, knowledge of the right price of stocks is essential. Why?
            <br>
            Because otherwise there is a high chance that the person ends up buying a bad stock.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Try using intrinsic value calculators</h2>
            But these calculators are not accurate. So how to make sure that we do not end up buying a stock at wrong price.
